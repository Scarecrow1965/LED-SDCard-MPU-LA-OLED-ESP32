This is almost the full series of upgrades to my computer wokstation.
This program now includes the following modules:
- my DOIT V1 Devkit ESP32;
- 4-relay module;
- Ultrasonic distance module;
- Micro SDCard module;
- OLED SSD1306;
- MPU5060 gyro and accelerometer module;
- 3x LED RGB Addressable strips; and
- 2x Linear Actuators.

I am using PlatformIO in VSCode for various reasons (library download/upgrades, series output, uploading to ESP32.
